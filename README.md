# SiPPP Action ðŸ¥¤

SiPPP is the Simple Photo Provenance Protocol. Learn more here: https://sippp.box

This is a farcaster action that verifies that a photo in a post has been sipped.
That is, the photo was registered to the blockchain immediately after being taken
with a camera within the SiPPP mobile app, proving that the photo is not AI 
generated or otherwise digitally altered. In other words, no filter, no cap.
